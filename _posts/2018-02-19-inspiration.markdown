First off, this Jekyll thing is stupid. I just spent an hour installing ruby to get a static blog site working. What advantage does this have over github markdown? Probably styling. But now I gotta learn Jekyll's special syntax. Why not just create straight up html code? or React? Or some other framework someone has heard of before?

I'm probably going to migrate this into something else once I get a round tuit.

# Do Header Tags Work?

If so, let's begin.

I am trying to get my direction in life under control, because temporarily, it isn't. I heard a great talk by zefrank about his depression and his issues with his own life's direction. His message was essentially "Do what you love, and don't let your great ideas sit around in your head going 'someday I'll do that'. Just do them, now, before they fester."

So that's what I"m doing. I'm writing this blog entry, because earlier I had the idea, "what if these insights I'm gaining where on a blog and everyone could benefit from my work, and I become famous as a wisdom-provider to the masses". That's not gonna happen, but it's one of those things your brain tells you to get you motivated, and I'm happy to lie to myself if it means progress.

I had the thought earlier, "your greatest inspiration is yourself". Now that I have run out of inspiration, I have no ideas left. 5 years ago I could have come up with 5 ideas off the spot for a website that I would have really wanted to do, but now, nothing. Because all the great ideas have festered in my head, grew old, and I gained a distaste for them. 

That was a lot of metaphor that may have no meaning, but hopefully that's what actually happened in a way.

So now I'm trying to re-locate my inspiration. And I think the best way is by going over my old writings of ideas in Evernote and such and seeing where the thoughts take me.

Then as I get ideas, I'll implement them, rather than sitting on them. If I get any sort of motivation at least, and if I think it would be enjoyable, and if I actually enjoy doing them. I'm really just done doing things that I hate because I think it'll be "good for me". As Felicia Day said (paraphrasing) I am my own worst disciplinarian.

And I know there was another thought that I had, but I forgot it. So now the blog post ends, as a memorial to those ideas that I don't implement or at least write down in time before I forget.
